## Installation

Unzip the download and place the `CookieNotice` directory in your `site/addons` directory.
Then add the `{{ cookie_notice }}` tag at the bottom of your layouts.

## Settings

### Override Styles
If you would prefer to use your own styles instead of ours, toggle the `Use your own styles` setting.

### Custom Notice Text
If you want to use some custom text for your notice, you can do so by entering it into the addon settings page.

### Location
If you want to change the position of the cookie notice, you can choose from either the Bottom or the Top of the screen.

### Don't accept
You can toggle if you would like to display the 'Do Not Accept' button. When clicked it will redirect the user to Google.

### Cookie Name
You can change the name of the cookie that is used by Cookie Notice. By default, it's something like `cookieNotice1.5` but you can change that to whatever you want.
